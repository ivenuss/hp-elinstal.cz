## HP-Elinstal.cz

This website offers electrician services and showcases the quality and scope of the work provided. It serves as a portfolio and informational resource for potential clients.

### Why Astro?

The site almost doesn't use any JavaScript, so there's no need to utilize a powerful frontend framework. Astro is the best fit for this type of static site. The majority of the content consists of pure HTML and CSS, with some parts enhanced by JavaScript (such as mobile navigation and opening hours availability). These features utilize Astro's [Islands Architecture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/).
